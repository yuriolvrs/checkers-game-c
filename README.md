# checkers-game-c
A terminal-based implementation of a simplified Checkers game written in C. The program supports randomized first player selection, diagonal movement, single-piece captures, win condition detection, surrender handling, and real-time piece count updates, all implemented under strict constraints (no global variables, modular design).
